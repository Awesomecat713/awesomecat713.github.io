<h1 id="title">Hi! This is my website.</h1>
<div id="about">
<p id="p1">This website may not be that interesting yet, but be warned, it will be soon. 
I don't know what you think of it right now, because this was probably written a long time ago, 
and right now this website <strong>sucks</strong>.</p>
<p id="p2">Anyway, I wanted to use mostly CSS for this page, becuase I wanted to put some CSS to use.</p>
</div>
<div id="sidebar">
<p>Click <a href="https://chloecodes.space">here</a> for my 'actual website' which is currently on Wordpress. 
Anyways, I am thinking about not using Wordpress, and just using the HTML file. 
I don't want any excess HTML that I don't understand or want on my <strong>own</strong> webpage...</p>
