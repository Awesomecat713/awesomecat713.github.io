<h1>Hi! This is my website.</h1>
<p id="p1">This website may not be that interesting yet, but be warned, it will be soon. 
I don't know what you think of it right now, because this was probably written a long time ago, 
and right now this website <strong>sucks</strong>.</p>
<p id="p2">Anyway, I wanted to use mostly CSS for this page, becuase I wanted to put some CSS to use.
